#### 1. First look at Scorsese’s next feature, *Silence*

Martin Scorsese has just finished shooting his latest feature, a passion project titled *Silence*, based on the novel of the same name by Shûsaku Endô. The story, set in the 17th century, centers on two Portuguese Jesuit priests who journey to Japan, where they face hostility and find that their mentor has abandoned his faith. The [first images](http://www.slashfilm.com/silence-images/) from the film have been released, revealing long-haired, bedraggled Andrew Garfield and Liam Neeson. The film also features Tadanobu Asano, Adam Driver, and Ciarán Hinds. Neeson and Garfield have both [talked](http://variety.com/2015/film/news/liam-neeson-silence-martin-scorsese-1201640172/) about the dedication that went into making the film and the difficult material that resulted. The hype that has surrounded the upcoming film, which will release late in 2016, and the subsequent re-release of the novel has caused Pedro Almodóvar to change the name of his newest movie from Silencio to Julieta, citing “too many silences at the same time.” 

#### 2. Ridley Scott announces new title for *Prometheus* follow-up
	
20th Century Fox has [confirmed](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ridley-scotts-prometheus-sequel-gets-840584) that the sequel to 2012’s *Prometheus*, which will be directed by Ridley Scott will be titled *Alien: Covenant*, set to release in October 2017. The released synopsis also revealed that Prometheus and Covenant are the first two films in a prequel trilogy that will connect directly to Scott’s 1979 *Alien*. Pre-production on films in this Alien universe have been hectic lately - Neill Blomkamp’s upcoming project, a film that would follow 1986’s *Aliens*, [has been put on hold](http://deadline.com/2015/10/neill-blomkamp-aliens-sequel-set-aside-for-prometheus-2-1201598007/) for the time being and *Alien: Covenant* has undergone title changes from *Prometheus 2* to *Alien: Resurrection* before settling on the current title. Elsewhere in the Ridley Scott cinematic universe, Ryan Gosling, who was [recently named by Sylvester Stallone](http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Ryan-Gosling-Rambo-Reboot-Actor-Responds-Stallone-Request-94837.html) as the actor who should take over the role of Rambo were the movie to be recast, has [confirmed](http://collider.com/ryan-gosling-blade-runner-2-nice-guys/) that he will star in the upcoming Blade Runner sequel.


#### 3. *Memento* remake announced

Last week, when AMBI Pictures acquired the rights to the Exclusive Media Group film library, it took ownership of the right to remake *Memento*. They wasted no time to launch a $200 million film fund, which will include a [remake](http://variety.com/2015/film/news/memento-remake-christopher-nolan-1201641515/) of Christopher Nolan’s beloved 2000 thriller/crime drama *Memento*. The original starred Guy Pearce as a man with no short-term memory leading a solo investigation. It is a fascinating and unique film, using black-and-white for some of the scenes, playing with the chronology of the storytelling, and leaving viewers not exactly sure if they understand what they saw. This has led many to wonder whether a remake was truly necessary, including [Guy Pearce](http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/18/memento-remake-guy-pearce) who tweeted, “I wonder why they'd do a remake anyway?  I mean we all know how it starts.....” which seems like a nonsense statement unless you’ve seen the film. AMBI now also has the rights to films like *Cruel Intentions*, *Rush*, and *Donnie Darko*, among others, so it will be interesting to see what gets remade next.
 
#### 4. Richard Linklater’s *Everybody Wants Some* to open SXSW Film Festival

Next year’s SXSW will be opened by the [“spiritual sequel”](http://www.avclub.com/article/richard-linklaters-spiritual-sequel-dazed-and-conf-228572) to the classic 1993 coming-of-age tale, *Dazed and Confused*. The filmmaker from Austin, who started the Austin Film Society and fostered a strong community that has brought up many young filmmakers, focused his newest film on a group of college baseball players in the 1980s. Linklater, who wrote and directed the film, also said that it could be seen as a very loose “continuation” of his most recent film, *Boyhood*, but the ensemble cast - Will Brittain, Zoey Deutch, Ryan Anthony Guzman, Tyler Hochlin, Blake Jenner, Glen Powell, and Wyatt Russell - and characters trying to “navigate their way through the freedoms and responsibilities of unsupervised adulthood” definitely recalls *Dazed and Confused*. SXSW opens on March 11, 2016 and will be the [world premiere](http://www.slashfilm.com/everybody-wants-some-sxsw/) of the film before it is released wide in April.

#### 5. Robert Rodriguez and John Malkovich want you to wait 100 years for their new film

As part of a promotion for Louis XIII Cognac, which is aged for 100 years before being sold, the company reached out who the global executive director called “the greatest actor of his generation”, John Malkovich, to work on a project that would demonstrate their commitment to quality products. From there, Robert Rodriguez was brought in [to make a film no one knows anything about](http://io9.com/john-malkovich-and-robert-rodriguez-have-made-a-movie-n-1743390289) other than that is is, according to Rodriguez, “emotionally charged.” Three teaser trailers, which reportedly do not contain any actual footage from the film, have been released, with three different looking futures.

#### 6. Duplass Brothers reveal they turned down a superhero movie

Jay and Mark Duplass [have said](http://www.slashfilm.com/jay-and-mark-duplass-superhero-movie/) that they were offered a superhero movie (they did not reveal from which studio) but turned down the offer. The mumblecore filmmakers said that working with a budget 50 times larger than their typical budget is not something they want to do and that a movie that large “is not a movie...it’s a commodity.” It’s not surprising that they were approached for a big budget feature, as studios recently seem to be very intent on hiring smaller-name, indie, male filmmakers - James Gunn (*Guardians of the Galaxy*), Colin Trevorrow (*Jurassic World*), Rian Johnson (*Star Wars*), Gareth Edwards (*Godzilla*), and most recently Taika Waititi (*Thor: Ragnarok*). Although they turned the studio down, Jay Duplass did pitch a superhero film that must but surely never will be made: “Batman and Robin as a 98 percent relationship drama in the Bat Cave.” It’s also a shame they turned down the film because it could have fostered a nice rivalry with the Russo Brothers over the best team of brothers making superhero films.


#### 7. Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck team back up for a Western

*Far Bright Star*, a Western about a cavalryman struggling to survive in the desert after his group is killed, will be [directed by Casey Affleck and star Joaquin Phoenix](http://variety.com/2015/film/news/casey-affleck-far-bright-star-joaquin-phoenix-1201643818/). The friends and brothers-in-law last worked together on the 2010 mockumentary *I’m Still Here*, which followed Phoenix after his retirement from acting and attempt to work as a hip hop artist which began a downward spiral. Since 2010, Phoenix has been on fire, starring in *The Master*, *The Immigrant*, *Her*, and *Inherent Vice*. *Far Bright Star* is an adaptation of the novel by Robert Olmstead.

#### 8. Emma Stone to star as Billie Jean King in *Battle of the Sexes*

Emma Stone will [reportedly](http://variety.com/2015/film/news/battle-sexes-emma-stone-billie-jean-king-1201644084/) play the role of Billie Jean King opposite Steve Carell as Bobby Riggs in the sports drama chronicling the 1973 tennis match between King and Riggs known as the “Battle of the Sexes.” Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the team behind *Little Miss Sunshine*, will direct the film. This story is one that is apparently on the minds of many people in Hollywood, as two other projects about the match - one starring Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti and another with Will Ferrell attached - are also in the works.
