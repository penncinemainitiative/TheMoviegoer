####1. Amazon Studios gets Nicolas Winding Refn’s new movie, to release theatrically next summer

Amazon picked up the rights to distribute *The Neon Demon* at the American Film Market this week. The film, starring Elle Fanning, Keanu Reeves, Christina Hendricks, and Jena Malone, focuses on a young model who moves to Los Angeles, and like most young models who move to Los Angeles in movies faces trials and turmoil. Refn has described the movie as “a horror film about vicious beauty.” Amazon Studios is aiming to become a larger force in movie distribution with the release of movies like this and Spike Lee’s *Chi-Raq*.

####2. Chloë Grace Moretz to star in Universal’s troubled *The Little Mermaid*
	
Moretz is the first name to be attached to this title since Sofia Coppola backed out of the project earlier this year. There were creative differences between the studio and the would-be director, possibly over whether to cast a well-known actress like Moretz as the lead. This movie has faced problems getting off the ground ever since it was announced. Richard Curtis (*Love Actually*, *Notting Hill*) is set to write the script.


####3. Netflix, Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment back Bong Joon-ho’s upcoming movie, all-star cast confirmed

Bong Joon-ho’s upcoming film, *Okja*, has received investment from Netflix as well as co-production support from Plan B. Bong has said the film centers on a young Korean girl and her experiences, journey and possible friendship with a monster named Okja. The film is not planned to be released until early 2017, but has already picked up a stellar cast. Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Bill Nighy, and Kelly MacDonald will all appear.
 
####4. Team behind *21 Years: Richard Linklater* set to make *21 Years: Quentin Tarantino* documentary

Tara Wood, the director of the documentary *21 Years: Richard Linklater*, which explored the work of the director, has announced that production has commenced on a project focusing on the career of Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino’s prolific career began in 1992 with *Reservoir Dogs*, with his latest, *The Hateful Eight*, set to hit theaters this Christmas. The documentary will feature interviews with many people who have worked with Tarantino, like Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, and Jennifer Jason Leigh.

####5. Brian De Palma’s next movie, an action-thriller called *Lights Out*, announced

*Lights Out*, a film about a blind girl caught in a plot to expose a top-secret assassination program, will be directed by Brian De Palma. The film is a Chinese project, backed by two Chinese production companies and set to star A-list Chinese action stars.

####6. Dazzling trailer released for animated feature *Boy and the World*, set to hit theaters December 11

The [trailer](http://www.indiewire.com/article/watch-boy-and-the-world-trailer-is-an-explosion-of-psychedelic-animation-20151110) for the upcoming animated film from distributor Brazilian director Alê Abreu begins by showing some of the more than 40 festival awards it has picked up this year. It then boasts that it is “a film unlike any you’ve seen before”. The rest of the trailer is convincing that the awards and the description are warranted. There is a vibrant mixture of colors, samba music, and a unique animation style. It looks like it will be an upcoming release that you won’t want to miss.


####7. *Snowpiercer* to be adapted into television show

Elsewhere in Bong Joon-ho news, his most recent film, *Snowpiercer*, is set to be adapted into a TV show. The film centers on the last humans on a frozen Earth, surviving on a train circling the planet non-stop. It will be interesting to see what kind of changes will be made to the story in the film, as the movie goes to some pretty dark places that are best discovered by seeing Chris Evans reveal them in the movie. Josh Friedman (*The Sarah Connor Chronicles*, *Crossbones*) will write the adaptation.

####8. Kickstarter campaign started to revive *Mystery Science Theater 3000*

In just the first few days it has reached almost $1.5 million of its initial $2 million goal.
