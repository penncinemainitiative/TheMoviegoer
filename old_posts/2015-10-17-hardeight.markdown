####1. Trailer for latest Coen brothers film “Hail, Caesar!” released

For their next film, “Hail, Ceasar!”, the Coen brothers have a strikingly impressive cast, including George Clooney, Josh Brolin, Channing Tatum, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Jonah Hill, Frances McDormand and Ralph Fienes. The internet was set ablaze this past week when the [first trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMqeoW3XRa0) for this film was released, showcasing the entire spectrum of eccentric characters played by this all-star cast. Set to be released on February 5th of 2016, “Hail, Ceasar!” should serve as an outlier in the early months of the year when most studios dump their disappointing and underperforming films.

####2. Netflix’s first original feature film, “Beasts of No Nation”, released on Friday

After creating hit shows such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, Netflix released its first feature film on Friday, October 16th. Set to be released simultaneously on Netflix as well as in Landmark theaters, “Beasts of No Nation” depicts the horrors of war, centered on the child soldier Agu. The release for this film remains controversial, as major theater chains such as Regal and AMC refuse to play the movie while it is accessible on Netflix’s streaming platform. Typically, most feature films must remain in theaters for ninety days prior to being made available online. Golden-Globe winner Idris Elba stars as a warlord who trains the orphaned Agu to be a fierce warrior. After debuting “Beasts” to rave reviews at the Venice Film Festival, Netflix aims to factor heavily into the Oscars, while establishing a new trend for feature film releases. 

####3. Tarantino reveals 70mm version of “Hateful Eight” contains additional footage

Similar to how Christopher Nolan advertised his Interstellar as possibly the last film to be shot in IMAX 70mm, Tarantino recently announced that the 70mm film version of the Hateful Eight, which will be in theaters a week earlier than digital prints, will also contain 7 minutes of additional footage. As such, this extended edition of the Hateful Eight rumors to clock in at 3 hours and one minute, which may be concerning for some but also very exciting for Tarantino’s rabid fanbase. As filmmakers such as Nolan and Tarantino continue to advocate for the preservation of shooting on film, creating incentives for the audience to help support this effort is imperative. 

####4. Johnny Depp “does not want to win” an Oscar, ever.

While it has been quite some time since Johnny Depp has been involved in Oscar talk, the success and praise of “Black Mass” has thrust him into the conversation. Surprisingly, Depp had some bold thoughts on the subject. When asked by the BBC, Depp stated that he would never want to win an Oscar, simply because he does not “want to have to talk”. Considering the fact that Joaquin Phoenix was nominated months after calling the Oscars “total bullshit”, expect Depp to still factor heavily into the Best Actor conversation these next few months.

####5. More details emerge on Wes Anderson’s next film, a stop-motion animated feature

Wes Anderson returns to the world of stop-motion animation, which he first used in “Fantastic Mr. Fox”, on a currently untitled feature centered on a pack of dogs. While details are scarce, Anderson seems to have coralled an all-star voice cast, including Ed Norton, Bryan Cranston, and Jeff Goldblum. According to Goldblum, the film will be “Japanese-inspired”, and should feature many of the stylistic quirks we love and associate with Anderson.

####6. Jennifer Lawrence pens essay about sexism, gender pay gap in Hollywood

In an essay written for Lena Dunham’s website, Lenny, Jennifer Lawrence expressed frustration and anger over sexism and the gender pay gap in Hollywood. After the debacle that was the Sony Email Hack, Lawrence (and the rest of the world), found out that she and her American Hustle co-star Amy Adams had been paid significantly less than their male counterparts. Lawrence also touched on being angry with herself for failing “as a negotiator” because she gave up too early. Lawrence’s article, coming just a week after Meryl Streep spoke out about sexism in Hollywood, has spurred much conversation, and will likely not be the end of this discussion. However, to many, feeling empathy for an actress who brings in an excess of 20 million dollars per role is challenging.

####7. George Miller says at least two more Mad Max sequels are planned (sadly with less Furiosa)

George Miller’s latest film in the Mad Max franchise, “Mad Max: Fury Road”, has been hailed as an action masterpiece and performed exceedingly well for a film that endured numerous production setbacks. While the film did not do huge numbers at the box office, it made enough profit and received enough praise for Miller to begin planning the next sagas of Max, played by the passionate and hot-headed Tom Hardy. Many viewers found Max, in “Fury Road”, to take a backseat to Furiosa, who served as the main protagonist and vehicle for the events on screen to progress. Unfortunately, Miller stated that Furiosa does not seem to factor into these sequels. Luckily, he also explained that everything is a work-in-progress, and hopefully, we may not have seen the last of Imperator Furiosa after all.

####8. Paramount streaming full movies on YouTube, plans to slowly make more available

Paramount has unveiled ‘Paramount Vault’, a YouTube channel that contains many feature-length films for absolutely free streaming. Of course, Paramount has not yet released its most legendary and well-known films such as Grease, Sunset Boulevard, and the Transformers films. Instead, the current portfolio of films include more esoteric films, including horror and cult classics. Ultimately, the Paramount Vault will likely serve as a cinephile’s new best friend, while opening up new avenues of film and cinema that many have not previously been exposed to.
