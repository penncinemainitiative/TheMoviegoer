The latest trailer for *Suicide Squad* was released this past week, and is one of the more exciting trailers in recent memory. Set to Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, the trailer showcases this memorable group of villains, most notably Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie. While many remain apprehensive of the film’s quality, whoever cut this [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmRih_VtVAs) deserves much recognition.

#### 4. *The Big Short* wins big at Producers Guild Awards

At the 2016 Producers Guild Awards, *The Big Short* took home the top prize as it solidifies itself as a major contender for Best Picture at next month’s Oscar. With a plethora of other accolades under its belt, the film emerges alongside *The Revenant* and *Spotlight* as the top three films vying for Oscar glory.

#### 5. Changes to be implemented in Academy of Motion Pictures

In the wake of outcries and frustration following a lack of diversity among Oscar nominees, the Academy has announced changes among its body to increase diversity and relevance. For example, the academy will add three more members to its board of governors, double the number of women and non-white members by 2020 and only allow those who have been active in the film industry within the last ten years to place votes. Despite all these changes, until studios provide more opportunity for minorities, little change will actually happen.
