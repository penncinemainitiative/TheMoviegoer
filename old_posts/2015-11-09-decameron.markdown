&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Ages is a term coined by the Romantics to define a period in history when there was little social mobility and even lower literacy rates amongst the people of Europe. Countries weren’t at a level of unification, and due to this, the boundaries drawn to distinguish different statehoods were ineffective at defining the true bounds of social interaction. Even those with power were barely related with the regions they had influence over.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasolini’s attempt to depict society at this time is an adaptation of a novel written by Giovanni Boccaccio in 1351. Six centuries later, Pasolini’s film demarcates an era defined more by desperation than by freedom. As a result of this, the film is an exploration of an ethical wasteland, in which many if not all the characters represent some kind of immorality, whether it be adultery, thievery, or hypocrisy. The characters therefore demonstrate their only freedom in what the world defines as sin. But this sin is a paradox since it is a demonstration of their freedom: their spirituality is therefore a vice. So the question remains whether their loyalty to their humanity paints them as sinners in Pasolini’s mind.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the narratives within the film follows a convent full of nuns, who practice abstinence, but are tempted upon the arrival of an attractive male. The dichotomy of the situation is that it lingers on the quest for true spirituality. Pasolini uses the adaptation as a method to question what it means to be human, and if that contradicts what it means to be virtuous. Because sex is more than just a physical act, the practice of abstinence can be interpreted as a contradiction of the nuns’ own humanity. They aim at serving God, yet they forbid themselves from God’s gift to humanity: sex.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions like this linger in the film. Is a thief redeemed because he’s been stolen from? Is adultery betrayal of someone else, or betrayal of oneself? The line between truth and tradition is challenged, but tradition isn’t simply represented by the Church. Tradition is the idea that purity is absolute virtue, and sin is absolute vice. On the contrary, the sins in the picture are placed in a context that force the audience to re-examine their flawed nature, and allow us to hesitate on judgment, which might be the greatest sin of all.
