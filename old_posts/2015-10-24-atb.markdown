####**PCI Weekly Screening**

PCI will be screening Kurosawa's classic, *Yojimbo*. In feudal Japan, a master-less samurai (Toshiro Mifune) enters a village run by two rival gangs and decides to force them into battling each other. The film was later adapted into the equally classic Western, *A Fistful of Dollars*. If you're still not convinced, staff writer Eric Eisner has written a great [preview](http://pennmoviegoer.com/2015/10/20/yojimbo.html) of the film. The screening will take place **Thursday 10/29 at 9:00pm** in Harrison M20. We hope you'll join us!

PCI will also be going to see *Entertainment* this **Tuesday, 10/27 at 6:00pm** at the Philadelphia Film Festival. *Entertainment* follows a bitter, downtrodden comedian, who resembles the real life infamous Neil Hamburger, as he treks across the southwest performing underwhelming gigs at near-empty venues in hopes of reuniting with his estranged daughter in wholly bizarre black comedy.

####**Gregory College House**

All films will start at 8:00pm on their respective dates.

####**International House of Philadelphia**
