####1. First full-length *Star Wars* trailer released
[The first official trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGbxmsDFVnE) for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* aired on Monday, adding to the buzz about the new film, set to release on December 18. In less than 24 hours, the video received 37 million views, 1 million fewer than its second teaser trailer, but still enough for the second most in a 24 hour period this year. The excitement for Star Wars fans continued as ticket pre-sales also opened this week, leading to more records for the movie, surpassing *The Hunger Games* for most tickets bought on the first day of sales.


####2. Chris Rock to host 2016 Oscars

Producers for the Academy Awards confirmed that Chris Rock would be the host of next year’s awards show. He previously hosted the 2005 awards. That year saw more viewers than most recent Oscars broadcasts. From 2014 to 2015, the broadcast saw a 16% drop in ratings, falling to the fewest viewers in over six years. This announcement follows an ongoing discussion about race in Hollywood; last year the Academy was criticized for overlooking people of color in the industry. Rock will likely appeal to a wider audience and change the path the awards show has been taking over the past few years.

####3. Leonardo DiCaprio on The Revenant- “One of the most unique moviegoing experiences ever”

In an [interview with Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/movies/leonardo-dicaprio-on-fighting-a-1281529422913590.html), DiCaprio described a grueling experience on set, which he says resulted in an intense product for audiences. The upcoming film, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and starring DiCaprio alongside Tom Hardy, follows the story of a 19th century explorer, stranded in the wilderness after being attacked by a bear. While shooting, DiCaprio recounts many sequences that were among the most difficult of his career. He also described dealing with the freezing cold, possible hypothermia, sleeping in animal carcasses, and eating raw bison. It’s impossible to say that he hasn’t committed to this role. DiCaprio, a perennial Oscar nominee, never a winner, will surely be a contender again this year, benefitting from his descriptions of the sacrifices he made for the benefit of art.		

####4. Jessica Chastain’s addresses gender wage gap in Hollywood

In an interview with Huffington Post, Jessica Chastain was the most recent actress to address the gender wage gap. While alluding to a report that indicated she made $7 million for *The Martian*, while Matt Damon made $25 million, she revealed that she actually made less than a quarter of that amount. Following Jennifer Lawrence’s essay, this is part of a pattern of standing up and speaking out against the huge disparities in Hollywood. Chastain indicated that it is wonderful that people are beginning to confront this issue, but there is still clearly a long way to go.

####5. Gotham Awards nominees released: *The Diary of a Teenage Girl*, *Carol*, *Tangerine* lead

The awards season may have officially started, now that nominations for the Gotham Awards have been [announced](http://deadline.com/2015/10/gotham-independent-film-awards-nominations-2015-full-list-1201590240/). These awards skew toward indie films, although bigger films that see success at the Gotham Awards can often ride the good press through to the Oscar season. *The Diary of a Teenage Girl*, a coming-of-age-tale, received four nominations, while the romance *Carol*, hyped for performances from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, and *Tangerine*, the film shot on an iPhone following two transgender characters in Los Angeles, both received three. Winners will be announced November 30, and they may be an indication of which films will receive Oscar buzz. 

####6. *Crimson Peak* falls flat at box office

Guillermo del Toro’s new gothic romance landed in a disappointing fourth place on the weekend box office, pulling in $13.1 million domestically in its opening. Part of the problem may have been due to the fact that the movie was heavily marketed as a horror movie, leaving audiences and critics disappointed by a lack of scares, even though del Toro strongly asserted that it was a romance with ghosts in it. Del Toro’s previous film *Pacific Rim* also opened to disappointing domestic numbers, but luckily performed very well in China. *Crimson Peak* likely won’t have that help however, due to censorship laws in China that forbid superstitious or cult elements, which includes ghosts. In an industry that is becoming more reliant on foreign box offices to cover huge budgets, it is unfortunate to see original passion projects doing poorly.

####7. Laverne Cox to star as Dr. Frank N. Furter in Fox’s TV *Rocky Horror* remake

Fox is remaking the classic film *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*, which celebrated the 40th anniversary of its release this year, for TV next year. This week it was announced that Laverne Cox, *Orange is the New Black* actress, will play the character Dr. Frank N. Furter, the sexually ambiguous scientist, originally portrayed by Tim Curry. *Rocky Horror* has gained a cult following thanks to 40 years of midnight shows. Cox may be the perfect person for this role, as she was the first trans woman of color with a leading role in a mainstream television show, the first transgender person to receive an Emmy nomination, and has been a strong voice in the LGBT movement.

####8. Jon Hamm joins cast of new Edgar Wright film

The newest film from Edgar Wright, *Baby Driver*, added Jon Hamm to its already big-name cast. Hamm will reportedly play a villainous character, alongside up-and-coming star Ansel Elgort, of *The Fault in Our Stars* and *Divergent* series fame, Lily James, who recently starred in 2015’s *Cinderella* and will appear in the upcoming *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies*, and Jamie Foxx. Wright began working on *Baby Driver* after he stepped down from directed Marvel’s *Ant-Man*. Hamm is most associated with his iconic role, Mad Men’s Don Draper, though after seeing him in Netflix’s *Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt* and *Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp*, the idea of him in an Edgar Wright movie is intriguing and just another reason to be excited about the film.
