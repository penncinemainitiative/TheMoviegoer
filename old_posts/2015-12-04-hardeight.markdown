####1. *Mad Max*, *The Martian*, *Room*, others win awards from the National Board of Review

In a somewhat surprising choice, blockbuster *Mad Max: Fury Road* won the best film award from the National Board of Review. It’ll be interesting to see how this initial awards success translates into Oscar chances. Another big winner was The Martian, another blockbuster, which won best director for Ridley Scott, best actor for Matt Damon, and best adapted screenplay for Drew Goddard. Room did well as well, with Brie Larson honored with best actress and Jason Tremblay with breakout performance. Other winners included the Tarantino flick *The Hateful Eight* and the Netflix’s *Beasts of No Nation*.

####2. *Carol* wins big at the 2015 New York Film Critics Circle
	
*Carol*, a romantic drama set in the 1950s directed by Todd Haynes and starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, won big at the New York Film Critics Circle, one of the first major critics groups to release their choices following the National Board of Review. *Carol* received honors for best film, best director, best cinematography, and best screenplay. This, along with *Carol*’s numerous nominations at the Spirit Awards, bodes well for the film as Oscar season begins warming up. However, that being said, the NYFCC’s choices had almost no overlap with those of NBR. Other winners at the NYFCC included Saoirse Ronan as best actress for her role in *Brooklyn*, winning over Brie Larson’s role in *Room*, and Michael Keaton as best actor for his role in *Spotlight*. 


####3. Ridley Scott announces two Alien movies after *Covenant* for trilogy 

Ridley Scott announced that after *Alien: Covenant*, the sequel to *Prometheus*, he’ll be making two more films, taking the plot to the original *Alien*. He cites inspiration from the *Star Wars* franchise, saying “*Star Wars* will be a juggernaut. Why do you think I’m doing sequels?” Hopefully, this prequel trilogy well be better received than those created by George Lucas for *Star Wars*.
 
####4. *Gods of Egypt* Director and Studio Apologize for White-Washed Cast

After outrage at the overwhelmingly white cast displayed in the first trailer of the blockbuster *Gods of Egypt*, both Director Alex Proyas and studio Lionsgate released statements apologizing for their casting choices. Proyas states: “The process of casting a movie has many complicated variables, but it is clear that our casting choices should have been more diverse.” An almost identical public outrage occurred following the trailer release of Ridley Scott’s *Exodus: Gods and Kings*, which starred Christian Bale as Moses and Joel Egerton as Ramesses II. *Gods of Egypt* stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for his role as Jaime Lannister, and Gerald Butler. In other news, [the movie looks insane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMVxECWC-vk). 

####5. New *Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice* trailer shows off Wonder Woman, Doomsday

The [second full trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fis-9Zqu2Ro) for Zach Snyder’s *Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice* was released, starting with the tense first meeting of Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne. Most notably, the trailer reveals Doomsday, who from the original comics was a monster from Krypton responsible for the death of Superman (he came back). In Snyder’s version, it looks like Doomsday is a reanimated General Zodd engineered by Lex Luthor to face Superman. The trailer ends with Wonder Woman saving Batman from Doomsday, the last shot being the “Trinity” of the DC Universe. Disappointingly, two trailers in and still no lines for Wonder Woman. It’s interesting that the Warner Bros. decided to spoil this crucial plot point of Doomsday - it isn’t as if they need to worry about ticket sales.

####6. Phil Lord and Chris Miller search for young Han Solo

Reports have come in that over 2,500 have auditioned for the Han Solo *Star Wars* spin-off set for release May of 2018. The project is helmed by Chris Miller and Phil Lord, directors of *The Lego Movie* and the *Jump Street* movies. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Miles Teller and Dave Franco have all reportedly auditioned for the role. The project is supposedly operating under the code name “Red Cup” in reference to the Solo Cup Company.

####7. Fox has to deny rumors of bear rape scene in *The Revenant*

Ridiculously, a Drudge Report post claimed that Leonardo DiCaprio’s character is raped in Alejandro Innaritu’s new film *The Revenant*. The trailer for the film shows an unsuspecting Dicaprio violently attacked by a bear, but showed no indication of any sexual content. Fox had to dismiss this claims, stating: “There is clearly no rape scene with a bear.” 

####8. *The Hateful Eight* press screening hurt by projection mishap

Quentin Tarantino’s newest film *The Hateful Eight* has been one of the most anticipated films of the year. One major aspect of the hype surrounding the movie is that it was shot on 70mm film, as Tarantino is one of the most vocal supporters of using film rather than digital projection. It comes as a huge disappointment to some, then, that at a recent Los Angeles press screening of the movie, there were problems with projecting the film. According to reports, the focus was not right, and after the intermission, the theater switched to a digital version of the movie. To add insult to injury, some people, including Drew McWeeney of HitFix have claimed that the digital version looked better than the 70mm print, despite Tarantino’s claims that it is essential to see the film version if you want to have the best experience. Whether it was a problem with the print itself or a projection booth mistake, it is alarming that for one of the most important screenings of the movie, they were unable to ensure the success of the projection. While it may have just been one mishap, it has many [wondering](http://www.hitfix.com/motion-captured/what-one-bad-screening-of-the-hateful-eight-means-for-the-future-of-film) about the future of film.
