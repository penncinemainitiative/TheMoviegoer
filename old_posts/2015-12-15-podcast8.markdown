Brad and Nikhil talk the horror/comedy mash-up, *Krampus*, on this week's podcast.

*When his dysfunctional family clashes over the holidays, young Max is disillusioned and turns his back on Christmas. Little does he know, this lack of festive spirit has unleashed the wrath of Krampus: a demonic force of ancient evil intent on punishing non-believers.*
