#### 4. David Brent is back in first look at *The Office* spinoff, *Life on the Road*

After you see Ricky Gervais ridicule celebrities as host of the 2016 Golden Globes this January, you’ll have the chance to see him reprise the role that turned him into a star. He returns next year as David Brent, manager of the UK version of ‘The Office’, who now aims to pursue a career as a musician. Gervais took to his [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rickygervais/) to showcase the first photos of the film, scheduled to be released sometime next Fall.

#### 5. Teaser Trailer for Spielberg’s *The BFG* released

Steven Spielberg returns to the realm of childhood fantasy and adventure next year with his highly-anticipated adaptation of Roald Dahl’s *The BFG*. The film tells the story of Sophie, played by newcomer Ruby Barnhill, who meets the eponymous Big Friendly Giant and finds herself on a magical adventure through Giant Country. Releasing on July 1st of 2016, *The BFG* should appeal to children and families worldwide. Watch the first teaser trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG5MtenlP-A). 

#### 6. J.J. Abrams endorses Ava DuVernay as future director in *Star Wars* saga

J.J. Abrams recently proclaimed *Selma*, directed by Ava DuVernay, as the most “well told and as sophisticated and human a film” to be released within the last 10 years. As such, he believes that she would be a perfect choice to join himself, Rian Johnson, and Gareth Edwards in depicting future installments of the ‘Star Wars’ saga. It is hard to imagine DuVernay making the transition to blockbusters, but if she does, she will thankfully place heavy emphasis on character and story before spectacle.

#### 7. Magnolia Pictures acquires Ben Wheatley’s *High-Rise*

The latest film from Ben Wheatley, who has previously delivered the gruesome and macabre *Kill List*, has been acquired by Magnolia Pictures for stateside distribution next year. Wheatley returns to the dark comedy-thriller he so passionately enjoys in *High-Rise*, based on a novel depicting the outbreak of class warfare in a condominium following power outages. Hopefully, *High-Rise* delivers on its social warfare premise as well as 2014’s great *Snowpiercer* did.

#### 8. Cate Blanchett to join Marvel Cinematic Universe

Reports indicate that Cate Blanchett is in final negotiations to star in *Thor 3*. While details regarding which role she would play are sparse, it is clear that Marvel remains great at drawing in top talent. Coming off her Oscar-winning performance in *Blue Jasmine* and her critically acclaimed performance in this year’s *Carol*, Blanchett is one of Hollywood’s most heralded actresses.
