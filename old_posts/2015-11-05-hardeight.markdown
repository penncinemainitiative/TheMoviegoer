#### 1. *Spotlight takes home top honors at Chicago Film Festival

After debuting to rave reviews at the Venice Film Festival, *Spotlight* continues to glean accolades after being awarded the Audience Choice Award at the 51st Chicago Film Festival this past week. Boasting a tremendous cast, *Spotlight* is now considered by many award watchers as to be the film to beat at next year’s Oscars. However, as we learned last year with *Boyhood*, being proclaimed a front runner early on does not always bode well. 


#### 2. First trailer for Spike Lee’s *Chi-Raq* released

Spike Lee presents his latest ‘joint’ with the release of the [trailer](https://vimeo.com/144523728) for *Chi-Raq*, a film focusing on the racial and economic tensions, bloodshed, and sex in the quasi-eponymous Chicago. The trailer delivers on shock-value, and showcases Samuel L. Jackson as well as *Dear White People* breakout star Teyonah Parris, but ultimately falls flat due to its ridiculous premise. The way to end prolific violence is for the women of Chicago to deny men sex? Really, Spike Lee? 
		

#### 3. Key & Peele to make stop-motion movie with *Coraline* director

Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele became household names due to their tremendously successful sketch comedy series, Key & Peele. Featuring numerous skits involving African-American culture, stereotypes, and simply the issue of race in America, Key & Peele has been heralded as an iconic show. While many were disappointed when the show concluded in September this year, fans now can look forward to their future project: a stop-motion picture, collaborated with the Henry Selick, director of *Coraline*, focusing on a pair of demon brothers and their battle against a group of goth teenagers. Key & Peele continue to stretch their creative boundaries, and can hopefully find success in their new endeavors. 

#### 4. Johnny Depp to receive highest honor from Santa Barbara Film Festival as “modern master”

It must feel awfully good to be Johnny Depp right now. After numerous films flopping at the box office and being panned critically, his latest film on the life of Whitey Bulger, *Black Mass*, has thrusted him into the good graces of Hollywood once again. Considered a strong candidate for a Best Actor nomination at next year’s Academy Awards, Depp will soon be receiving the Maltin Modern Master Award from the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. Depp will likely continue to receive numerous accolades as award seasons progresses, and may even be gracing the nominee field at the Oscars after seven years.

#### 5. *The Lobster*, *Macbeth*, *45 Years* top British Independent Film Awards nominations

*The Lobster* leads the way at the British Independent Film Awards with seven nominations, while both *Macbeth* and *45 Years* garnered six nominations of their own. All three have been widely praised, but may not see widespread release on this side of the pond. Regardless, expect these three films to be widely pushed for greater awards consideration in the following months.

#### 6. “Project Greenlight” drama results in final product panned by critics

After serving as the setting of numerous controversies, most surrounding the outspoken (and misspoken) views of creator Matt Damon, Project Greenlight has finally unveiled its final product- *The Leisure Class*. Produced by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, Project Greenlight is a documentary series that offers amateurs a chance to direct a feature film. The winning feature of Season 4, *The Leisure Class*, premieres on HBO on November 6th, and early reviews by critics were far from kind. With *The Leisure Class* being panned, perhaps Project Greenlight was not meant to be resurrected after a ten year hiatus after all. 

#### 7. Latest trailer for *The Hateful Eight* released today

Amid controversy surrounding Quentin Tarantino’s comments at an anti-police brutality rally, the latest [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_UI1GzaWv0) for *The Hateful Eight* was released this morning. Featuring an expected amount of violence, blood, and Samuel L. Jackson, this full-length trailer surely whets the appetite of Tarantino fans everywhere, many of whom are eagerly awaiting its Christmas release date. 

#### 8. Sony aims to reboot ‘Dragon Tattoo’ series, without the involvement of Craig, Mara, and Fincher

David Fincher’s version of “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” proved to be dark, gritty, and well-made. For all purposes, it was a standard David Fincher film with an incredible cast led by Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara. However, despite being well received by critics and performing well for a hard-R rated film released during the Holidays, Sony felt overall dissappointed in the film’s box-office returns. More so, executives at Sony were put off at Fincher’s tight control over editing and marketing. It has now been reported that Sony is looking to delve back into the world of Lisbeth Salander, but without the involvement of its previous director and cast. Recent rumors suggest that Sony is attempting to draw in 2015’s it girl, Alicia Vikander, to portray Salander - a move certainly in the right direction.
