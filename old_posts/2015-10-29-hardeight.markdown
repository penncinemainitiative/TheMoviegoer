####1. George Clooney reteams with Coen Brothers for next directorial project

For his next directorial project, George Clooney is teaming up once again with Joel and Ethan Coen. The brothers will write the script for the film, a noir drama by the name of *Suburbicon*, reportedly set in the 1950s with thematic similarities to the critically acclaimed *Blood Simple*. This will be Clooney’s sixth time working with the siblings, previously working with them on notable films such as *O Brother, Where Art Thou?* and *Burn After Reading*. Their most recent collaboration is *Hail, Caesar!*, whose all star cast also includes Scarlett Johansson, Josh Brolin, Tilda Swinton, and Channing Tatum. The film, set in the Golden Age of Hollywood, hits theaters in February.

####2. Tarantino boycotted by police unions after protesting against police brutality

This past weekend, Oscar-winning director Quentin Tarantino marched in a rally organized by a group named #RiseUpOctober, protesting against police brutality. He spoke to the crowd gathered at the event, stating “When I see murders, I do not stand by, I have to call a murder a murder and I have to call the murderers the murderers.” Since the rally, the New York, Los Angeles, New Jersey, and Philadelphia police unions have all called for a boycott of Tarantino’s films. Tarantino yet to respond. It’ll be interesting to see if these calls for boycotts affect the success of Tarantino’s latest project, *The Hateful Eight*, out on Christmas Day.

####3. *Star Wars* pre-sales break record

Fandango, the nation’s largest online ticket seller, has revealed that *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* is generating “unprecedented ticketing demand,” breaking the record for first day pre-sales. The company reports that they have sold eight times as many tickets as they did on the first day of sales for the previous record holder, *The Hunger Games*. Other companies, such as AMC Theatres and Movietickets.com, also reported record breaking pre-sales, with many sites crashing due to traffic. IMAX sales have been particularly high, with a staggering $6.5 million in sales from the first day. Undoubtedly, this success was fueled by the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the latest trailer released. These early numbers bode well for the blockbuster’s potential to break more records at the box office come December. 

####4. Ricky Gervais returns as Golden Globes Host

It was announced that Ricky Gervais, best known for creating and starring in the original UK version of The Office, will return for his fourth time to host the Golden Globes Awards. The comedian had previously vowed to never host again after many felt that his jokes had crossed lines of taste and civility. After the announcement, Gervais tweeted: “"It's a good job I'm drunk. Otherwise the thought of hosting The Golden Globes again would seem like a real pain in the arse,” seemingly on track to host yet another controversial and memorable Golden Globes.

####5. Female directors, producers lead to more women in crew

The Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego University found that having a female director or producer greatly increased the number of women in crew positions. Particularly dramatic is the increase in female writers, who make up 8% of all writers on films with male directors but slightly over 50% on films with female directors. This is only the most recent headline highlighting the challenges women face in Hollywood, previous instances including Jennifer Lawrence’s essay on the gender pay gap for actors and the ACLU’s call to investigate gender discrimination in Hollywood.
	
####6. *Unbroken* finally shown in Japan after accusations of historical inaccuracy and racism

Despite attempts to have it banned in Japan, Angelina Jolie’s *Unbroken* will finally open in Japan in February. The film tells the true story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete who spent years as a Japanese prisoner of war during World War II. Japanese nationalist groups attempted to ban the movie from their country, citing what they consider to be a misrepresentation of Japanese POW camps. However, historically, there is credible documentation on the abuse and torture endured by Japanese prisoners of war. The film, which was released on Christmas of 2014 in the U.S., will open in Tokyo in February through the Japanese distribution company Bitters End Inc.
	
####7. Chris Pine cast as Steve Trevor in *Wonder Woman* movie

Warner Bros. has cast Chris Pine, star of the rebooted *Star Trek* franchise, as Steve Trevor in the stand-alone *Wonder Woman* movie set for 2017. Steve Trevor is a supporting character of Wonder Woman’s in the comics, a love interest often in need of saving by her. It’s an interesting gender flip on the stereotypical ‘damsel-in-distress’ formula, and Pine is a perfect fit, having the charisma central to the character in spades. He has expressed excitement over the role, stating: “What excited me most is to work in a movie with a superhero woman. With a woman in the lead role.” Pine also cited the female director, Patty Jenkins, who previously directed another movie with a female lead, the critically acclaimed Monster, for which Charlize Theron won an Oscar. Despite these promising signs, only time will tell if Warner Bros. can compete with Disney’s Marvel franchise. *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice*, the next movie in the DC franchise, opens in March.

####8. George Lucas gifts $10 million to aid underrepresented minority students at USC’s Film School

Despite the fervor around *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, the man largely responsible for the franchise seems to have faded into the background, with minimal involvement in the film. HIs latest project, the animated Strange Magic, bombed both critically and at the box office. However, the USC School of CInematic Arts just received a staggering $10 million from the George Lucas Family Foundation to provide financial support to African-American and Hispanic students, officially the largest single donation for student support in the school’s history. Lucas stated “Hispanic and African-American storytellers are underrepresented in the entertainment industry. It is Mellody’s and my privilege to provide this assistance to qualified students who want to contribute their unique experience and talent to telling their stories.” Regardless of what you may think of Lucas as a filmmaker, everyone can get behind that.
