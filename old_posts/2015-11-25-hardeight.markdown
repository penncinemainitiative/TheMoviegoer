**This week's edition has been slightly truncated due to the holidays.**

#### 1. Universal backed *By The Sea* in hopes of drawing Jolie to future projects

Universal Studios is hoping for a silver lining after the the critical and box-office bomb that was *By The Sea*. Reports state that Universal backed the Angelina Jolie-Brad Pitt vanity project hoping that Jolie would re-team with the studio for either *Wanted 2* or *Bride of Frankenstein*. Although this seems like a huge gamble considering the fact that *By The Sea* has resulted in a nearly $40 million loss for the studio, Universal Studios has had a widely successful year following the billion-dollar successes of *Jurassic World* and *Furious 7*.

#### 2. First Trailer For *Captain America: Civil War* released
	
After saving the world twice together, and grossing over two billion dollars combined, your favorite team of Superheros are now at odds with one another. In the [first trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVdV-lxRPFo) for *Captain America: Civil War*, Chris Evans’ Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man are in the midst of a battle stemming from concerns over governmental guidelines regarding the authority of superheros. The latest Marvel installment hits theaters on May 6th, 2016. 


#### 3. *Carol*, *Spotlight*, *Beasts of No Nation* lead Spirits Awards nominations

A few Oscar hopefuls gained a boost this past week after the 2016 Spirits Awards nominations were [announced](http://www.spiritawards.com/nominees/). Leading the pack was Cate Blanchett’s *Carol* with six nominations, followed by the Netflix-distributed *Beasts of No Nation* and *Spotlight* with five each. While *Carol* and *Spotlight* have been anointed as major Oscar contenders already by critics, *Beasts of No Nation* benefits the most, aiming to stay relevant over the coming months after a tepid theatrical release.
 
#### 4. Official U.S. trailer released for Malick’s next feature, *Knights of Cups*

Although Terrence Malick has released only eight films over a career spanning four decades, he has become much more prolific over the past few years. With a total of three high-profile projects already in post-production, Malick seems to be making up for lost time. Scheduled to be released in the United States on March 4th, 2016, his next feature “Knights of Cups”, features a tremendous trio of actors including Christian Bale, Natalie Portman, and Cate Blanchett. Catch the latest trailer for the film [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl6BWTIZeOg). 

#### 5. *Mockingjay - Part 2* opening-weekend gross is lowest of entire franchise

Although claiming the top spot at last weekend’s box-office with over $100 million, *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 2* opened significantly lower than previous installments of the series. While far from a failure, this underperformance likely stems from poorer critical reviews and audiences’ tepid reaction to the slower and darker tone established in these previous two films. 

#### 6. Jennifer Lawrence announces plans for directorial debut

In an interview with *Entertainment Weekly*, Jennifer Lawrence announced she has already signed on to direct *Project Delirium*, based on a 2012 news article on the use of mental warfare in the 1960’s. As she wraps up promotional work for the final installment in the *Hunger Games* franchise, Lawrence seems poised to continue to take the film industry by storm. She will be seen next in David O. Russel’s next film, *Joy*, on Christmas Day.
